> _If you want it to remain free and fabulous, it could use a moment of your time in reviewing it._ **Thanks!**

# 🎯 MODULE: System Requirements (PVE/WHMCS)

## WHMCS must have >100 services!

New Biz: Fresh Installations/Businesses using WHMCS need to take note of the Service ID <100 case.

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is CRITICAL, as **Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100 (system).** 

_If you don't have enough services (of any status) in WHMCS (DB: tblhosting.id), create enough dummy/test entries to reach Service ID 101+._ **Else you're likely to see an error which explains this:** 

`HTTP/1.1 400 Parameter verification failed. (invalid format - value does not look like a valid VM ID)`

To check, browse to your **latest** service in WHMCS, then check the URL - it will reveal the Service ID. If it is less than 100, subtract it from 100 to deduce how many "dummy services" you need to add in a dummy order. 

**Once over 100, it fits the requirement & you're good!**

## General Requirements

- **(WHMCS)** v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- **(WHMCS)** **Service ID above 100**
- **(NET)** WAN Access: WHMCS to PVE
- **(VNC)** Special Requirements: PTR, etc.
- **(PHP)** v8.x.x (latest stable version)
- **(PHP)** max_execution_time = 300
- **(Proxmox)** 2 users (API & VNC)
- **(Proxmox)** VE v8.x.x (current)

# ✅ MODULE: Installation & Configuration

**DON'T SKIP ANY PART OF THIS README.md - please don't raise pointless Issues - thank you!**

## 📋 1. PREP: Upload & Configure the Module

Check the System Requirements above, and resolve any blockers to using Proxmox VE for WHMCS.

### 👥 PVE: User x2 Requirement (API & VNC users)

#### Credentials: root account for each PVE host

**You must have a root account to use the Module at all.** Configured via WHMCS > Servers.

This is configured in the pam realm. We plan to allow selection in v1.2.9.

#### Credentials: VNC user for Console Access only

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must also have a Restricted User. 

Configured in the _Module_ as detailed below, once you've added/restricted it in PVE.

### 🏃‍♂️ INSTALL: Getting ready to use the Module!

First up, get the basics sorted out:

0. Upload the Module to your WHMCS installation, ensuring correct permissions/ownership.
1. Activate it via WHMCS > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Activate.
2. In the same spot post-activation, expose the Module to Administrators.
3. Make sure your Proxmox host has a valid SSL Certificate installed.
4. Ensure you've TCP/8006 connectivity between WHMCS & PVE.

Once you've done all of that, in order to get the module working properly, you need to:

0. Proxmox VE > Create an additional VNC-only user, per instructions below
1. WHMCS Admin > Config > Servers > Add (Advanced) > PVE Host/s (User: `root`; IPv4: `PVE's`; no port suffix!)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add KVM/LXC Plan/s
4. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IPv4 Pool
5. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
6. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > **SAVE** (links Module Plan to WHMCS Service type)

## 🥽 2. noVNC: Console Tunnel (Client Area)

After forking the module, we considered how to improve security of Console Tunneling via WHMCS. We decided to implement a routing method which uses a secondary user in Proxmox VE with very restrictive permissions. 

This is due to be re-built again to further enhance security.

### How to offer VNC via WHMCS Client Area

1. Install & configure the module properly
2. Follow the PVE User Requirement info below
3. Public IPv4 for PVE (or proxy to private)
4. PVE and WHMCS on the same Domain Name*
5. Have valid PTR/rDNS for the PVE Address

If proxying, that is your responsibility to diagnose.

Else, PVE must be WAN-accessible and all other configs/reqs satisfied.

### Creating the VNC User within Proxmox VE

1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > ` Datacenter / Permissions / Group`
2. Create new User "vnc" > `Datacenter / Permissions / Users` - Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Roles` - Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Permit VNC Access -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Add Group Permissions` - Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret = 'vnc' password (PVE) you set

> Do NOT set less restrictive permissions. The above is designed for hypervisor security.
> 
> **However, if you wish for proper security, wait for VNC to be further improved.**

### Important info about Console Access

noVNC has been overhauled. It isn't guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)

- Note #1 = You must use different Subdomains on the same Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).
- Note #2 = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend `novnc_router.php` - ideally we/someone will optimise this to better cater to all formats.

## 🌐 3. Networking: IPv4 Pools, IPv6, vmbr/SDN

### IPv4: Pool required for assignment

Please make sure you create an IP Pool with sufficient scope/size to be able to deploy addresses within it to your guest VMs and CTs. Else it won't be able to create a Service for you.

**Private IPs for PVE Hosts:** Note that VNC may be problematic without work due to the strict requirements introduced in Proxmox v8.0 (strict same-site attribute).

### IPv6: SLAAC default, 2nd vNIC

Per The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS#33 there's SLAAC/DHCP/off available (2x vNICs) (May 2024).

You can of course add different config via PVE/`pvesh` manually, if you need to specify a prefix.

### vmbr / SDN: Config type

This depends on your configuration on the PVE Host/s - bridge (vmbr0 etc) or software-defined (SDN).

**If normal (bridged)** - use `vmbr` as the Network, then use `0` as the Interface ID - this makes up `vmbr0`.

**If SDN (Software Defined Network)** - use SDN Name for Network, leave Interface ID blank (= no suffix).

## ⚙️ 4. VM/CT PLANS: Setting everything up

These steps explain the unique requirements for QEMU & LXC guests.

**Custom Fields:** Values need to go in Name & Select Options.<br>
This needs configuring for each `WHMCS Admin > Products & Services` entry.

### VM Option 1: QEMU, PVE Template VM Clone

Firstly, create the Template VM in PVE. You need its unique PVE ID.

Use that ID in the Custom Field `KVMTemplate`, as in `ID|Name`.

> Note: `ID` is the Unique ID that your Template VM has in PVE.<br>
> Note: `Name` is what will be displayed to your Clients in WHMCS.

### VM Option 2: QEMU, WHMCS Plan + PVE ISO

Firstly, create the Plan in WHMCS Module. Then, WHMCS Config > Services.

> Under the Service, you need to add a Custom Field `ISO` with the full location.<br>
> This ISO must be located on the PVE Host, and not on the WHMCS installation side.

### CT Option 1: LXC, PVE Template File

Firstly, store the Template in PVE. You need its storage, folder & File Name.

> Use that prefixed file name in the Custom Field `Template`, as in:<br>
> `local:vztmpl/ubuntu-99.99-standard_amd64.tar.gz|Ubuntu 99`

#### ZFS etc: Comfigure to suit isolated TPL

- `local` is the name of the file-system that you have the Template on
- `vztmpl` is the directoty name per convention, with the ISO within
- `ubuntu-99.99-...` etc is the Template file name, exactly as-is

ie. If using ZFS for Templates, substitute local with volume name.

#### Password: Configure the CT's root user

Make a 2nd Custom Field `Password` for the CT's root user.

## 🔄 5. PATCH: Updating the Module

**Check:** `WHMCS Admin > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Support/Health`

You should download any new version & upload it over the top, then run any needed SQL queries.

### SQL: Keeping your DB up-to-date

Please consult the **UPDATE-SQL.md** file, open your WHMCS DB & run the statements. 

Then you're done with each update! Not all versions need database amendments.

## 🆘 6. HELP: Best-effort Support

### Before raising a GitHub Issue, please check:

1. The Wiki.
2. The README.md.
3. Open GitHub Issues on the repo.
4. HTTP, PHP, WHMCS & debug logs (see below).
5. PVE logs; best practices; network; etc.
6. Read the errors. Do they explain it?

### Issues/etc raised must include:

**Logs:** We work to ensure that Proxmox VE for WHMCS passes through error details to you.

#### All Logs & Debug Logging too

- **(Logs: PHP)** `error_log` contents
- **(Logs: WHMCS)** Module Debug Logging*
- **(Logs: Config)** WHMCS Display/Log Errors = ON
- **(Logs: PVE)** Logs from Proxmox Host/s (`pveproxy` etc)
